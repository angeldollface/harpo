*A Dart package for numeric encryption/decryption and binary & hexadecimal encryption/decryption! :lock:*

## About :books:

Harpo is a small library to numerically decrypt/encrypt letters, words, and phrases!

## Installation :inbox_tray:

### Adding to your project

To add Harpo to your project's dependencies, add this to your project's `pubspec.yml`:

```YAML
dependencies:
  ...
  harpo:
    git: git://github.com/angeldollface/harpo.git
```

The three dots represent anything else that you might have in the `dependencies` section.
Having done that, re-fetch your project's dependencies by running this in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ dart pub get
```

## Usage :hammer:

Import all functions like this:

```dart
import 'package:harpo/harpo.dart';
```
